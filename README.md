YarnGdx is a Libgdx library for creating interactive dialogue in games! YarnGdx is able to parse programs made with [Yarn][1]. Yarn's minimal syntax is very similar to that of [Twine][2], so Twine users should be able to transition easily. If you don't know Twine or Yarn yet dont worry - It is super easy to learn the basics and get started. The Yarn language is used in several well known games like [Night In The Woods][20].

There is a simple code example in the tests package that can be run like a normal libgdx project.
