YarnGdx is a Libgdx library for creating interactive dialogue in games! YarnGdx is able to parse programs made with [Yarn][1]. Yarn's minimal syntax is very similar to that of [Twine][2], so Twine users should be able to transition easily. If you don't know Twine or Yarn yet dont worry - It is super easy to learn the basics and get started. The Yarn language is used in several well known games like [Night In The Woods][20].

There is a simple code example in the tests package that can be run like a normal libgdx project.

## Getting Started
- First thing you want figure out is how you want to include YarnGdx in your project.
- Even though you could use any old text editor to create your dialogue files - I would recommend heading over and downloading the latest build of the [Yarn Editor][5]. It is very easy to understand and offers some useful features like color coding and node tags.
- Once you are all set up and are ready to get started implementing Yarn Dialogues into your game go ahead to the [YarnGDX Wiki][4] for an in depth guide.
